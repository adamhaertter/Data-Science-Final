# Initial Steps

## Scraping Data

See our [Python scraper](scripts/scrape_vgchartz.py). VGChartz renders its data through a JavaScript table, so the data itself is not accessible through the native HTML for R scraping.

## Wrangling Data

See [wrangle_data.R](scripts/wrangle_data.R).

## Loading Data into Environment

Rerun this if you need to reset the master table. The dataframe with all info is called `master`

```{r}
load(file = here("data", "wrangled", "wrangled_data.rda"))
```

# Data Analysis

```{r}

```
